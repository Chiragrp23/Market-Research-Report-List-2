<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Full Bridge Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With PWM</li><li>Without PWM</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Full Bridge Driver market consists of two main types: With PWM and Without PWM. With PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) refers to drivers that have the capability to modulate the width of the input pulses, allowing for precise control of the output signal's duty cycle. This enables efficient control of motor speed and power in applications such as robotics and electric vehicles. On the other hand, Without PWM drivers lack this modulation capability, making them more suitable for simpler applications that do not require fine-grained control of the output signal.</p></p>
