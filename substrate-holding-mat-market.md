<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Substrate Holding Mat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li><li>Non-Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Substrate Holding Mat market consists of two main types: Intumescent Substrate Support Mat and Non-Intumescent Substrate Support Mat. The Intumescent Substrate Support Mat is designed to expand when exposed to high temperatures, creating a barrier to protect the substrate. It provides thermal insulation and fire resistance. On the other hand, the Non-Intumescent Substrate Support Mat does not expand upon exposure to heat but still provides physical support to the substrate. Both types have their specific applications and are used to hold and protect substrates in different industries.</p></p>
