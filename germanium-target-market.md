<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Germanium Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plane Target</li><li>Rotating Target</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Germanium is used as a target material in various industries, and two common target market types for Germanium are plane target and rotating target. Plane targets are stationary and typically used in processes where the deposition is required on a flat surface. On the other hand, rotating targets are used when coating or deposition needs to be done in a uniform manner on a 3D surface. These rotating targets rotate during the process, ensuring even distribution of the Germanium material onto the desired substrate or surface.</p></p>
