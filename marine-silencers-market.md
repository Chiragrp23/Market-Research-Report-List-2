<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Silencers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Marine Silencers market consists of two main types: resistive and reactive. Resistive silencers are designed with perforated plates and sound-absorbing materials to reduce noise by dissipating the energy through resistance. On the other hand, reactive silencers utilize reactive chambers and cavities to reflect sound waves and cancel out noise through interference. Both types aim to minimize noise emissions in marine vessels, with resistive silencers focusing on absorption and reactive silencers emphasizing the reflection and cancellation of sound waves.</p></p>
