<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Post-Applied Waterproofing Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet-based Membrane</li><li>Liquid Applied Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Post-applied waterproofing membranes are used to protect structures from water infiltration after construction is completed. There are two main types: sheet-based membranes and liquid applied membranes. Sheet-based membranes are pre-fabricated sheets made of materials such as bitumen or thermoplastics, which are laid over the substrate. Liquid applied membranes, on the other hand, are fluid materials that are applied directly onto the substrate and form a continuous waterproof layer when they cure. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on factors like the type of substrate and application requirements.</p></p>
