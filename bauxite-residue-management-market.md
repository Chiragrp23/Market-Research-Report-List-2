<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bauxite Residue Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Stacking</li><li>Wet Storage</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bauxite residue management in the dry stacking market involves the disposal of residue in a dry and consolidated form, minimizing the use of water during storage. This method ensures the residue remains stable and reduces the risk of environmental contamination. On the other hand, wet storage is a market type where the residue is stored in water-ponds or impoundments. This method requires the continuous addition of water to maintain the residue in a liquid form, which poses potential environmental risks if not managed properly.</p></p>
