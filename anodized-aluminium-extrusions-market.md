<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anodized Aluminium Extrusions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Anodization</li><li>DC Anodization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anodized aluminum extrusions refer to a process in which a layer of protective oxide is created on the surface of aluminum profiles. AC anodization uses alternating current to create the oxide layer, resulting in a harder and more durable coating suitable for outdoor applications. On the other hand, DC anodization uses direct current to produce a thinner and smoother oxide layer, making it ideal for cosmetic applications or components that require a higher level of precision. Both methods offer different properties and applications in the anodized aluminum extrusions market.</p></p>
