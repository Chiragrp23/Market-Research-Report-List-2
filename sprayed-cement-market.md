<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sprayed Cement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Spraying</li><li>Wet Spraying</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sprayed cement, also known as shotcrete, is a construction technique where cement mix is pneumatically projected onto a surface. There are two main market types in sprayed cement: dry spraying and wet spraying. In dry spraying, dry mix is propelled through a nozzle and water is added at the nozzle to create a wet mix upon impact with the surface. Wet spraying, on the other hand, involves pre-mixing the cement and water to create a slurry, which is then sprayed onto the surface. Both methods offer efficient and durable solutions for various construction applications.</p></p>
