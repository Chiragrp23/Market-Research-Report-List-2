<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dishwashing Detergents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saponification</li><li>Non-saponification</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dishwashing detergents can be categorized into two main market types: saponification and non-saponification. Saponification detergents are made by combining fats or oils with an alkaline substance, resulting in soap formation. These detergents have a strong grease-cutting ability but can leave residue in hard water. On the other hand, non-saponification detergents are usually formulated with synthetic surfactants that do not require a chemical reaction. They are more effective in hard water, provide better foam, and are widely used in modern dishwashing detergents.</p></p>
