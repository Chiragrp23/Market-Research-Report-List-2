<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymeric Flexible Tubing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Elastomers</li><li>hermoplastic Resins (Non-Elastomeric)</li><li>Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymeric flexible tubing is divided into three main types: thermosetting elastomers, thermoplastic resins (non-elastomeric), and thermoplastic elastomers (TPE). Thermosetting elastomers are materials that solidify when heated and cannot be melted again. Thermoplastic resins, on the other hand, are non-elastomeric materials that soften when heated and can be remolded. Lastly, thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) combine the properties of both elastomers and thermoplastic resins, offering flexibility and moldability when heated. Each type of tubing serves different applications and industries based on their unique properties and characteristics.</p></p>
